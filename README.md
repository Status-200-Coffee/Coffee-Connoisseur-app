# Coffee Connoisseur Frontend

# Summary
Coffee connoisseur is a react expo app designed to enable people to find the best coffee shops closest to them. The idea is to enable to anyone to have access to coffee shops in various cities as recommended members.

This front-end app utilises a back-end API built using Mongo DB to access application data.

# Using the app
The front end application satisfies the following user needs:

- map shows two closest ones and the routes to get to them
- coffee shops are above 4*
- set preferences on distance away
- users can submit photo of their favourite coffee at each coffee shop
- users can leave a review
- users can have a member benefit of when they leave a certain number of reviews
    and favourite coffees they get a free coffee
- Users can add new coffee shops  
- Users can view a list of coffee shops close to them 
- Users have option of using location services or inputting postcode and city
- Users can set text size larger or smaller
- Users can set the app to light or dark mode in settings

As a Guest user - the default user for the Home page - you can search for coffee shops in your local area, filter and sort results, and view further details of individual coffee shops. You will not be able to leave reviews, access personlised profile page, or access rewards without registering as a member. 

To access member benefits, select the menu in the top right corner, and then the login button to register first.
